# Sales Forecasting and Optimization
## Overview
This project aims to predict future sales for retail and e-commerce businesses using historical sales data. It involves data collection, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, time-series forecasting, model optimization, and deployment. The goal is to develop an accurate forecasting model to optimize inventory, marketing, and sales strategies.

## Project Milestones

### 1. Data Collection, Exploration & Preprocessing
- Collect historical sales data with relevant features (e.g., sales amount, date, promotions, holidays, weather, etc.).
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends, seasonality, and data quality issues.
- Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and engineering time-based features.

### 2. Data Analysis & Visualization
- Conduct statistical analysis to examine correlations between sales and external factors.
- Visualize trends using time-series plots, bar charts, and interactive dashboards (Plotly/Dash).

### 3. Model Development & Optimization
- Implement forecasting models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, Facebook Prophet, XGBoost, and LSTM.
- Train models using time-series validation techniques and evaluate performance using RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.
- Optimize hyperparameters using Grid Search, Random Search, or Bayesian Optimization.

### 4. MLOps, Deployment & Monitoring
- Track experiments using MLflow and manage model versions with DVC.
- Deploy the forecasting model using Flask/Streamlit for real-time and batch predictions.
- Monitor model performance and set up alerts for performance degradation.

### 5. Final Documentation & Presentation
- Document the entire process, including insights, challenges, and business value.
- Prepare a presentation to demonstrate the forecasting modelâ€™s functionality and impact.
